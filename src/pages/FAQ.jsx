    },
    {
      q: "What are the system requirements?",
      a: "Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) with a stable internet connection is enough. No external installation needed.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I access the portal from mobile devices?",
      a: "Yes, our portal is fully responsive and accessible from phones, tablets, and desktops.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need any special sensors or hardware?",
      a: "No additional sensors or metering hardware are required. The system is designed to work entirely with manually collected or existing data exported to Excel.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens after I upload my utility data?",
      a: "Once an Excel file is uploaded, the system extracts, checks, and stores the data. It then analyzes daily usage, tracks trends, and compares each utility’s consumption to pre-set threshold values.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does the system alert me if usage goes above a threshold?",
      a: "If a utility’s consumption is found to exceed the defined threshold for any period, the system instantly generates a pop-up alert on the dashboard and can optionally send notifications by email.",
    },
    {
      q: " Can I customize the threshold levels for different utilities?",
      a: "Yes, threshold values for energy and water consumption can be set and adjusted according to your facility’s operational goals or regulatory requirements.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is historical data and trend analysis available?",
      a: "The system stores all uploaded data, generating historical graphs and reports so you can monitor trends, compare periods, and evaluate improvement over time.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can reports be exported for record-keeping or presentations?",
      a: "Yes, all data, trend graphs, and summaries can be exported to common formats (including Excel and PDF) to facilitate reporting, compliance, or review",
    },
    {
      q: "Who receives the alerts and recommendations?",
      a: "Designated facility managers and stakeholders will see alerts and recommendations via the dashboard. Optional notification settings enable alerts by email.",
